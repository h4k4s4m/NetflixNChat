# NetflixNChat
Chrome extension aimed at connecting friends watching Friends® on Netflix®

This chrome extention uses jqeury to build a gui atop your netflix screen and allow you to chat and sync video with you and your friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, family or watch a movie with a stranger! (watching with strangers coming soon)

Techy info:

The front end consist of jquery and socket io libraries as well as a main content script and a main style sheet. The backend is express, socket.io and is ran on a free heroku server. Currently there aren't multiple channels so everyone is in the same room for chat and syncing.
